# Web-Dev-Projects
Documenting the beginning of my web dev journey

It's barely been a week since I started learning web development.
So far i've finished the HTML and CSS sections of the course im following. 
The next step in the course is bootstrap but i think i'll put it off for now as im more interested in learning javascript and using the react library.
According to the internet JS is an easy language to learn. Considering my prior experience with C, C# and Python i hope to get the hang of it quickly.

Anyway the first thing I'm uploading is the main page of my future portfolio. Eventually, after i learn some JS i'll start adding projects to the projects
section but right now i want to make a simple, good looking and eye catching site.
