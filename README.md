My Personal Portfolio Project

This started out as a repo where I would place simple pages I created while practicing HTML and CSS, but has since evolved into being a repo for my Personal Portfolio where I also put projects, which I deem okay. I've still got a long way to go but with every day spent learning and practicing I feel better about the projects I create.

To open the main homepage of my portfolio you need to open portfolio.html
